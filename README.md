# Hunter-s-Education-data-project
This Project will analyze GSS data from the 2022 panel. The project focuses on variables related to race and ecucation and seeks to examine or find the racial inequalities that exist within Amercian educational structures. It is important to note that the 2022 GSS panel data is very limited in terms of it's inclusion of Black particiants and respondents. Therefore, the findings from this research project should not be made generalizable to groups of Black people in American educaitonal institutions.
Using race and education variabels with the GSS data, I plan to answer the question: is Race impactful to peoples' confidence in education? 
  - as a background (but important) interest, I am leaving age and sex in the mix of variables to find if either of these variabeles are more impactful than race.

I hypothesize that race will show to be impactful to people's confidence in education. I think that people who are of dominant racial categories will have higher levels of confidence in education. People in subordinant or minority racial groups will have lower conficedence levels about education. 
  - This hypothesis grows from the idea of eurocentricity in education. Because American educational instittutions tend to operate on white standards, these institutions favor and support white students. WHite students tend to be more succesful in American schools than racially diverse students. This will cause white students to have more trust and confidence in these institutions. On the other hand, Black peple have histroically been withheld from equitable education, facing legal and econmic barriers reguarding education. This history of racism, exclusion and opression would keep Black people weary and caution about college, lowering their confidence levels.

Alt theory 
 - Racial captialism - education is a racially capitalist system which takes advantage of people of color. White pople who are less affected by this racist captialism would contintue to hold high confidence standards. Black people or any other racial minority Who are being exploited by this machine would be less confident in it.
